# Guess_the_number_python
This is a simple game where the user guesses a random number generated by the computer.
I have set 3 levels of difficulty, under 10, under 50 and under 100.
Clues to correctly guess the number is also provided for every wrong guess.
The number of guess taken is also displayed in the end.
